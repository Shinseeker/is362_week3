Suppose you have ridden a bicycle from New York City to Key West, Florida. Your bicycle odometer shows the total miles, which you have dutifully logged at the end of each day with paper and pencil. Your first two entries might be 55 and 120, indicating that you rode your bike 55 miles on day 1 and 65 miles on day 2.
